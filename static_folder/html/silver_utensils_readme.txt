1. silver utensil page is for displaying silver utensil images and the page is a static one whith images loaded to it
        the flow of the page is such that when a user click the magnify button present below each image they are 
        directed to a modal page overlaying the main silver utensil page in the back ground.

        /######################################## in the modal #########################/

2. the modal page is the place where the maginifed image and below the maginifed image there is a related image
        section displaying images related to the magnified image.

3. the related image section contains of carousel of images 
4. above the magnified image there is a button which displayes the details of the magnified image . 

        /############################## ########################################################/

5. few CONSTRAINS to be kept in mind as the code is not highly maintainable so it provides us with few constrains 
        like the carousel image number must be only 9 and not exceed the number. 
        THE IMAGES DISPLAYED IN THE CAROUSEL OF RELATED IMAGE SHOULD BE FROM THE MAIN FILE OF THE IMAGE DIRECTORY,such
        is the logic of the program for the display of the image.
